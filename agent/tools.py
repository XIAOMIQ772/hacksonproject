APPLY_PATCH_DESCRIPTION = """Create, change, rename and delete files with a patch. The patch is a stripped-down, \
file-oriented diff in this envelope:

*** Begin Patch
[ one or more file sections ]
*** End Patch

Each file section starts with one of three headers:
*** Add File: <path> - create a file, or replace an existing file completely. Every following line is a + line \
(the initial content), including empty lines (a lone +).
*** Delete File: <path> - remove an existing file. Nothing follows.
*** Update File: <path> - change an existing file in place, optionally followed by *** Move to: <new path> to \
rename it.

An Update File section holds one or more changes. Each change is a run of lines, each starting with one \
character: a space for an unchanged context line, - for a line to remove, + for a line to add. Give about 3 \
context lines above and below each change, copied exactly from the file, so the location is unique. When that \
is not enough (similar code in several places), start the change with an @@ line naming the enclosing line, \
such as `@@ function SheetPage() {` or `@@ router.post('/sheets', async (req, res) => {`: the change is then \
looked for after that line. Separate changes in one file with @@ lines; give them in file order. End a change \
that must apply at the end of the file with *** End of File. A change of only + lines is inserted right after \
its @@ line; ended by *** End of File instead, it is appended to the file. To replace a whole file, use Add File.

Example:
*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: frontend/src/hello.ts
+export const hello = 'Hello';
*** Update File: backend/src/app.js
@@ app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
-  res.json({ code: 200, message: 'Backend Ready' });
+  res.json({ code: 200, message: 'OK' });
 });
*** Delete File: frontend/src/old.ts
*** End Patch

Rules:
- Paths are relative to the workspace root; node_modules cannot be edited.
- Prefix every added line with +, also in a new file.
- Context and removed lines must match the file; differences in leading or trailing whitespace and typographic \
quotes or dashes are tolerated. A change whose lines match several places without an @@ line is refused.
- Put every change you already know, for several files, into one patch. Prefer Update File with small changes \
to replacing a whole existing file: every line you send costs output time.
- Each file is written only if all of its changes apply; the other files of the patch are still written, and \
the result lists the failed changes with the closest lines in the file. Resend only those.
- Do not re-read a file after a successful patch to verify it: the result reports every failure."""
